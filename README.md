A short script that helps you stay focused while working

Essentially, the script closes a social media website that you might be distracted by whenever you open it. The script uses pyautogui to scan for the logo of the social media site because all social media sites have their logo at the top somewhere. When it detects that a logo is on the screen it uses the hotkey "ctrl" and "w" to close the tab. This is all done with pyautogui.
